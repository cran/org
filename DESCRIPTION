Description: A framework for organizing R projects with a standardized structure. 
    Most analyses consist of three main components: code, results, and data, 
    each with different requirements such as version control, sharing, and encryption. 
    This package provides tools to set up and manage project directories, handle 
    file paths consistently across operating systems, organize results using 
    date-based structures, source code from specified directories, create and 
    manage Quarto documents, and perform file operations safely. 
    It ensures consistency across projects while accommodating different 
    requirements for various types of content.
